/**
 * Interface for entities that have translations in multiple languages.
 * this interface is used in the scenario where we want to actually maintain
 * those entities in all defined languages. This is to distinguish from the
 * other scenario where we only want to display such data in one of the
 * languages, e.g. specified by the locale of the browser.
 * <p>
 * The name "Definition" was not very considerate and I'm planning to refactor
 * this one day. In fact those Definition* classes should rather be some kind
 * of Entity class while the normal entities are closer to projections or DTOs.
 * But that's something to consider for the future when the important functionality
 * is implemented.
 * <p>
 * The DefinitionEntity contains a set of DefinitionTranslations.

 *     the type of the id property
 * @param <T>
