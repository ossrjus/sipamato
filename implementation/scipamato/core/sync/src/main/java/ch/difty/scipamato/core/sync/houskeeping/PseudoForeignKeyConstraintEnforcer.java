/**
 * {@link Tasklet} used for enforcing pseudo-referential integrity rules. This is necessary
 * since not all SciPaMaTo-Public tables fully normalized, as they simply replicate some of the data
 * that is properly managed within SciPaMaTo-Core (and enforced with proper database referential integrity there).
 * <p>
 * As an example, in SciPaMaTo-Public, the code_class_id column in table code_class is not unique. It is only part
 * of a composite key, together with the languageCode, i.e. there is one translation in each defined language for every
 * logical code class maintained in scipamato-core.
 * <p>
 * With this, we cannot use code_class_id in table code as a foreign key to code_class.code_class_id. Therefore we
 * cannot define a delete cascade rule, as it is not a proper foreign key with a unique constraint. In case a code_class
 * is deleted in scipamato-core, we cannot rely on the database to cascade the delete to any code in scipamato-public
 * that references the code class that is deleted.
 * <p>
 * This tasklet allows to define a delete statement that does just that, where this is appropriate. If a null delete
 * condition step is passed into the constructor of this tasklet, the tasklet will operate as a no-op tasklet, simply
 * doing nothing when #execute is called.
 *
 * @param <R>
 *     type of {@link UpdatableRecordImpl} - the record to purge.
